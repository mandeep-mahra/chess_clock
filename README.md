# Chess Clock

A chess clock is a device used in turn-based games like chess to manage the time allocated to each player. It consists of two separate clocks that are placed next to each other.

## Features

- Two independent clocks: Each player has their own clock to track their individual time.
- Button controls: The clocks include buttons that allow players to start their clock while stopping their opponent's clock.
- Simultaneous pause: The clocks are designed to prevent both clocks from running simultaneously.
- Time limits: Chess clocks can be set with a specific time limit for each player's moves.
- Time tracking: The clocks display the remaining time for each player.

## Usage

1. Set the initial time: Before starting the game, set the initial time on each player's clock.
2. Begin the game: Player 1 starts their clock by pressing their clock's button, which stops Player 2's clock and starts counting down Player 1's time.
3. Make a move: Player 1 makes their move within the allocated time.
4. Switch clocks: After Player 1 completes their move, they press the button on their clock, which starts Player 2's clock and stops their own.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4: Players take turns making moves until the game concludes.

## Examples

Here are some popular chess clock models:

- Digital Chess Clock

- Other board games: Chess clocks can be adapted for various turn-based games like Scrabble, Go, and Checkers.
- Legal settings: Chess clocks are occasionally employed in legal proceedings where each party is allocated a specific amount of time to present their case.
